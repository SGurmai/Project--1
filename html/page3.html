        <p class="desc">The 14th century marked a continued evolution in armor 
        technology and usage, influenced by the changing dynamics of warfare and 
        advancements in metallurgy. This period saw refinements in existing armor 
        types as well as the emergence of new defensive gear to meet the challenges
         of combat. At the outset of the century, plate armor began to gain 
         prominence, gradually supplanting chain mail as the primary form of 
         protection for knights and elite warriors. Innovations in forging 
         techniques allowed for the creation of larger, articulated plates that 
         offered superior coverage without sacrificing mobility. Furthermore, the 
         14th century witnessed the widespread adoption of firearms, particularly 
         in the latter half of the century. This necessitated modifications to
          existing armor designs to withstand the ballistic impact of bullets and 
          projectiles, leading to the development of specialized plate configurations 
          and reinforced helmets. In addition to plate armor, padded garments such as 
          gambesons continued to be essential components of a warrior's defensive 
          ensemble. These quilted layers provided crucial protection against blunt 
          force trauma and served as an effective supplement to metal armor. 
          The 14th century also saw advancements in helmet design, with various styles 
          catering to different combat scenarios and preferences. From the iconic 
          great helm to more specialized visored helmets, head protection evolved to 
          offer a balance of defense, visibility, and comfort. In summary, the 14th 
          century witnessed a period of innovation and adaptation in the realm of armor, driven by the demands of e
          volving warfare and the relentless pursuit of improved protection on the battlefield.</p>
