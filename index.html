                    <h3>Understanding Armour</h3>
                    <p>Armour (Commonwealth English) or armor (American English) is a covering used to protect an object, 
                        individual, or vehicle from physical injury or damage, especially direct contact weapons or projectiles during combat, or from a potentially dangerous environment or activity 
                        (e.g. cycling, construction sites, etc.). Personal armour is used to protect soldiers and war animals</p>

                    <h3>Etymology</h3>
                    <p>The word "armour" began to appear in the Middle Ages as a derivative of Old French. It is dated from 1297 as a "mail, defensive covering worn in combat". 
                        The word originates from the Old French armure, itself derived from the Latin armatura meaning "arms and/or equipment", with the root armare meaning "arms or gear".</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>Armor has played an integral role throughout documented history. Crafted from a diverse array of materials, its origins trace back to the use of leathers and fabrics for protection, 
                        gradually evolving through chain mail and metal plates to the sophisticated composites we have today. Throughout much of military history, 
                        the creation of metal personal armor has been at the forefront, shaping the technology and utilization of armor.</p>

                <div class="div2">
                    <p>The progression of armor has been a driving force behind key technologies in the Ancient World, spurring advancements such as wood lamination, mining, metal refining, 
                        vehicle manufacturing, leather processing, and later, intricate metalworking for decorative purposes. Its production wielded significant influence during the industrial revolution, 
                        fostering the commercial growth of metallurgy and engineering. Armor stands as the paramount factor in the evolution of firearms, marking a revolutionary shift in the landscape of warfare.</p>

                    <p>Crucial considerations in the evolution of armor encompass both economic and technological imperatives in its production. Plate armor, for instance, 
                        emerged in Medieval Europe when water-powered trip hammers expedited and reduced the cost of plate formation. At various points, 
                        the progression of armor has mirrored the development of increasingly potent weaponry on the battlefield, prompting armorers to devise enhanced protection without compromising mobility.</p>
